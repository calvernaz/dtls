# Go DTLS implementation

This is my work in progress DTLS implementation in pure Go.
It is not working at all yet, except for the DH_anon handshake.

## TODO

[] Get encryption and decryption working for AES + SHA
[] Implement authenticated handshake
[] Implement alert protocol
[] Clean up the implementation
[] Add tests
[] Implement other cipher suites
[] Maybe implement extensions
[] Extend TODO list
